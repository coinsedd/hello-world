Just another repository
Hello,
I am Ricardo Fontanot, studied engineering a long time ago, never let go on practicing what I learned in life, and nowadays I design webpages to sell over the Intenet. I do everything by myself, and I am tyred of it. It is very difficult for me to find somebody taht would contribute to my work. And.... I found Github. 
Bravo. Now I am fully inspired to continue with a recent effort of designing my first Bot with Google Dialogflow, Google Actions and so forth. I am looking forward to having my Bot working with Google Assistant, as far as I understand that that is possible.
Wouldn't it be exciting to have lots of people in Mexico interacting with my Bot, whose invocation would be, as far as I understand: OK Google: Want to talk with Dr. Ayuda (Help)...
